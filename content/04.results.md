### Somatic Mutational Landscape of Pediatric Brain Tumors

#### Low-grade astrocytic tumors

Figure 2A depicts the oncoprint for 227 primary low-grade astrocytic tumors. As expected, the majority (62%, X/227) of these tumors harbor a somatic alteration in BRAF, with canonical BRAF::KIAA1549 fusions as the major oncogenic driver. 
We observed additional mutations in FGFR1 (2%), PIK3CA (2%), KRAS (2%), TP53 (1%), and ATRX (1%) and fusions in NTRK2 (2%), RAF1 (2%), MYB (1%), QKI (1%), ROS1 (1%), and FGFR2 (1%), concordant with previous studies highlighting the near universal upregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway in these tumors (@doi:10.1186/s40478-020-00902-z; @10.1016/j.ccell.2020.03.011).

#### Embryonal tumors (N = 131)
Figure 2B depicts the oncoprint for 131 primary embryonal tumors within the OpenPBTA, consisting of medulloblastomas (N = 97), atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (N = 24), embryonal tumors with multilayer rosettes (N = 2), other CNS embryonal tumors (N = 6), ganglioneuroblastoma (N = 1), and CNS neuroblastoma (N = 1).

#### Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors
In Figure 2C, we show an oncoprint for diffuse midline gliomas (N = 34) and non-midline high-grade gliomas (N = 29). The single oligodendroglioma sample in the OpenPBTA does not contain mutations in the genes shown and is therefore not present in this oncoprint. 
We found TP53 (57%, X/64) and H3F3A (52%, X/64) to be the most frequently mutated genes, followed by frequent mutations in ATRX (30% N/64). 
We found recurrent amplifications and fusions in EGFR, MET, PDGFRA, and KIT, highlighting that these tumors utilize multiple oncogenic mechanisms to activate tyrosine kinases, as has been previously reported (@doi:10.1007/s12254-021-00680-x; @doi:10.1002/ijc.32258; @doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2017.08.017; @doi:10.1186/s40478-020-00905-w). 
The two tumors with ultra-high tumor mutation burden (TMB) (> 100 Mutations/Mb) were from patients with known mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noz192).

#### Other CNS tumors (N = 199)

### Landscape of Mutational Processes

This section summarizes the mutational landscape of the pediatric brain tumor samples of this dataset.
Figure {@fig:openpbta-overview}A shows the tumor mutation burden as compared to adult TCGA brain-related tumors.
Figure {@fig:mutational-landscape-overview}B-C show concordance of these samples with mutational signatures from COSMIC [@url:https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic] and Alexandrov et al, 2013 [@doi:10.1038/nature12477] signature sets.

### Copy Number Variant Overview

![This figure shows dominant statuses for small copy number consensus segments (< 10 Mb) across the genome, where each square represents a ~1 Mb binned section of the genome.
A dominant status is declared if one status is >75% coverage.
Unstable indicates multiple non-neutral statuses totaling coverage >75%.
Copy number segments longer than 10 Mb have been removed from the figure for easier interpretability.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/raw/master/figures/pngs/cn_status_heatmap.png){#fig:copy-number-status-heatmap width="7in"}

### Recurrence and co-occurrence of mutations

This section will discuss the genes and regions that are repeatedly mutated within and between cancer types.
The occurrence of mutations in affecting particular genes, separated by tumor type is shown in Figure {@fig:occurrence-plots}A, with significant co-occurrence across all types illustrated in Figure {@fig:occurrence-plots}B.

B) Co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity of nonsynonymous mutations between genes.
The co-occurrence score is defined as $I(-\log_{10}(P))$ where $P$ is defined by Fisher's exact test and $I$ is 1 when mutations co-occur more often than expected and -1 when exclusivity is more common.

### Quantify Telomerase Activity using Gene Expression Data

We used gene expression data sets from both poly-A and stranded RNA-Seq protocols to predict telomerase activities using EXTEND [@doi:10.1101/2020.05.21.109249] as shown in [Supplementary Tables](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/tree/master/analyses/telomerase-activity-prediction/results).

For both platforms, EXTEND scores were highly consistent between FPKM versus counts data (Supplementary Figure) {@fig:comparison-plots}A and Figure {@fig:comparison-plots}B.

We next examined telomerase activity across different brain tumor histological subtypes using data from the stranded FPKM protocol. 
Across the short histological groups, we found germinomas had the highest EXTEND scores. 
However, teratomas, another type of germ cell tumor, had much lower scores (Figure) {@fig:distribution-plots}A.
Teratomas were previously reported to have negligible or low telomerase activities [@doi:10.1093/jnci/91.15.1321]. 
Teratomas originating from the tissue of three dermal layers of an embryo, are benign germ cell neoplasms [@doi: 10.1097/MOP.0b013e32832b41ee].
These tumors are divided into mature and immature (malignant) groups, where pediatric tumors are mostly classified as mature ones [@doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2004.03.045]. 
Mature tumors are deficient of malignant potential thereby reducing the risk of malignancy [@doi: 10.1016/j.jpedsurg.2004.03.045], hence bearing low telomerase activities.
Benign neoplasia including dysplasia and hemangioblastomas had the lowest scores. 
Among common pediatric brain tumors, medulloblastomas had higher scores than high grade astrocytic tumors, ependymomas and low-grade astrocytomas. 
Across broad groups, benign tumors and precancerous lesions were among those with the lowest scores, whereas pineal region and embryonal tumors have the highest scores (Figure) {@fig:distribution-plots}B. 
Considering medulloblastoma tumors, high risk Group3 and Group4 subtypes had higher scores than WNT and SHH subtype (Figure) {@fig:distribution-plots}C. 
A similar pattern has been speculated with respect to cell of origin by one of the earlier studies [@doi:10.1007/s00401-013-1198-2] which mainly focused TERT promoter mutations for medulloblastoma subtypes comparisons rather than telomerase activity.
