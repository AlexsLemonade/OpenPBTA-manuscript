## Peer review

All pull requests will undergo peer review.
Participants in this project should review pull requests, which can be done using [GitHub's review interface](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews/ "GitHub: about pull request reviews").
They should suggest modifications or, potentially, directly edit the pull request to make suggested changes.
As a reviewer, it's helpful to note the type of review you performed: did you look over the source code, did you run the source code, did you look at and interpret the results or a combination of these?

Before a repository maintainer merges a pull request, there must be at least one affirmative review.
If there is any unaddressed criticism or disapproval, a repository maintainer will determine how to proceed and may wait for additional feedback.
