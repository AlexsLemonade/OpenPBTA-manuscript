## Introduction

Pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors are the second most common tumors in children after leukemia, yet they represent the leading disease-related cause of death in children [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noz150]. 
Five-year survival rates vary widely across different histologic and molecular classifications of brain tumors.
For example, most high-grade and embryonal tumors carry a universally fatal prognosis while children with pilocytic astrocytoma have an estimated 10-year survival rate of 92% [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/now207]. 
Despite their relative rarity, the years of potential life lost due to brain tumors in 2009 was estimated at 47,631 years for children and adolescents aged 0-19 in the United States [@doi:10.1159/000093896]. 
The low survival rates for some tumors are clearly multifactorial but can be explained in part by our lack of understanding of the ever-evolving array of brain tumor molecular subtypes, difficulty drugging these entities, and the shortage of drugs specifically labeled for pediatric malignancies. 
Historically, some of the most fatal, inoperable brain tumors, such as diffuse midline gliomas, were not routinely biopsied due to perceived risks of biopsy and the paucity of therapeutic options that would require tissue. 
Limited access to tissue to develop patient-derived cell line and mouse models has been a barrier to research. 
Furthermore, the incidence of any single brain tumor molecular subtype is relatively low due to the rarity of pediatric tumors in general. 
Together, these factors have hindered research progress and have led to multiple national and international center and consortia efforts to collaboratively share specimens and data to accelerate breakthroughs and clinical translation. 

There has been significant progress in recent years to elucidate the landscape of somatic variation responsible for pediatric brain tumor formation and progression, however, translation of therapeutic agents to phase II or III clinical trials and subsequent FDA approval has been slow. 
Within the last 20 years, the FDA has approved only five drugs for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors: mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma; anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, for microsatellite instability–high or mismatch repair–deficient tumors; NTRK inhibitors larotrectinib and entrectinib for tumors with an NTRK 1/2/3 gene fusions; MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib, for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas. 
This is, in part, due to pharmaceutical company priorities and/or concerns regarding toxicity that have resulted in an inability to obtain drugs for pediatric clinical trials, ultimately delaying access to new agents.
An amendment to the Pediatric Research Equity Act called the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act mandates that as of August 18, 2020 all new adult oncology drugs also be tested in children when the molecular targets are relevant to a particular childhood cancer. 
Here, we present a comprehensive, collaborative, open genomic analysis of nearly 2,000 tumor specimens and 38 cell lines, comprised of 59 distinct brain tumor histologies from 943 patients. 
These analyses can be used to support the RACE Act and accelerate rational clinical trial design.
