## Discussion

We created OpenPBTA to provide an open, reproducible analysis framework to genomically characterize pediatric brain tumors and bring together researchers and clinicians from across the globe.
We provide robust code and data resources to the pediatric oncology community, encouraging interdisciplinary scientists to collaborate on new analyses in order to accelerate therapeutic translation for children with cancer, goals we are seeing play out in real-time.
To our knowledge, this initiative represents the first large-scale, collaborative, open analysis of genomic data coupled with open manuscript writing, in which we comprehensively analyzed the largest cohort of pediatric brain tumors to date, comprising 1043 tumors across 58 distinct histologies. <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
<!--QUESTION: Do we want the tumor count above to be exact?-->
We used available WGS, WXS, and RNA-Seq data to generate high-confidence consensus SNV and CNV calls, prioritize putative oncogenic fusions, and establish over 40 scalable modules to perform common downstream cancer genomics analyses, all of which have undergone rigorous scientific and analytical code review.
We detected and showed expected patterns of genomic lesions, mutational signatures, and aberrantly regulated signaling pathways across multiple pediatric brain tumor histologies.

Molecular subtyping information from pathology reports was largely not collected nor available for this cohort, and if available (e.g.: sparse medulloblastoma subtypes), it required manual curation from pathology reports and/or free text clinical data fields.
Furthermore, in the absence of DNA methylation data, rapid classification to derive molecular subtypes could not be performed.
Thus, to enable biological interrogation of specific tumor subtypes, we created RNA- and DNA-based subtyping modules aligned with WHO molecularly-defined diagnoses.
We worked closely with pathologists and clinicians to build modules from which we determined a research-grade integrated diagnosis for 59% of samples while discovering incorrectly diagnosed or mis-identified samples in the OpenPBTA cohort. <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->

We harnessed RNA expression data for a number of analyses, yielding important biological insights across multiple brain tumor histologies.
For example, we performed subtyping of medulloblastoma tumors, for which only 35% (43/122) had subtype information from pathology reports. <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
Among the subtyped tumors, we accurately recapitulated subtypes using MM2S (91%; 39/43) or medulloPackage (95%; 41/43) [@doi:10.1186/s13029-016-0053-y; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008263]. <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
We then applied the consensus of these methods to subtype all medulloblastoma tumors lacking pathology-based subtypes.

We used an expression classifier to determine whether tumors have dysfunctional _TP53_ [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076] and the EXTEND algorithm to determine their degree of telomerase activity using a 13-gene signature [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20474-9].
We found that hypermutant tumors universally displayed dysregulation of _TP53_ and that EXTEND scores are a robust surrogate measure for telomerase activity, as tumors with high scores had a significant adverse risk for overall survival.
Additionally, high _TP53_ scores were a significant negative prognostic indicator for overall survival for patients with certain tumor types, such as H3 K28-altered DMGs and ependymomas.
By assessing _TP53_ and telomerase activity prospectively from expression data, information usually only attainable with DNA sequencing and/or qPCR, we can quickly incorporate oncogenic biomarker and prognostic knowledge and expand our biological understanding of these tumors.

We identified enrichment of hallmark cancer pathways and characterized the immune cell landscape across pediatric brain tumors, demonstrating tumors in some histologies, such as schwannomas, craniopharyngiomas, and low-grade gliomas, may have a inflammatory tumor microenvironment.
Of note, we observed upregulation of IFN$\gamma$, IL-1, and IL-6, and TNF$\alpha$ in craniopharyngiomas, tumors difficult to resect due to their anatomical location and critical surrounding structures.
Neurotoxic side effects have been reported when interferon alpha immunotherapy is administered to reduce cystic craniopharyngioma tumor size and/or delay progression [@doi:10.3171/2015.2.PEDS14656; @doi:10.5348/ijcri-2013-12-419-CR-13].
Thus, additional immune vulnerabilities, such as IL-6 inhibition and immune checkpoint blockade, have recently been proposed as therapies for cystic adamantinomatous craniopharyngiomas [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noy035; @pmid:34966342; @pmid:32075140; @doi:10.1007/s00401-018-1830-2; @doi:10.3389/fonc.2019.00791] and our results noted above support this approach.
Finally, our study reproduced the overall known poor infiltration of CD8+ T cells and general low expression of _CD274_ (PD-L1) in pediatric brain tumors, further highlighting the urgent need to identify novel therapeutic strategies for these immunologically cold tumors.

OpenPBTA has rapidly become a foundational layer for a number of discovery research and translational projects which will continue to add other genomic modalities and analyses, such as germline, methylation, single cell, epigenomic, mRNA splicing, imaging, and model drug response data.
For example, the RNA fusion filtering module created within OpenPBTA set the stage for development of the R package _annoFuse_ [@doi:10.1186/s12859-020-03922-7] and an R Shiny application [_shinyFuse_](http://shiny.imbei.uni-mainz.de:3838/shinyFuse/).
Using medulloblastoma subtyping and immune deconvolution analyses performed herein, Dang and colleagues showed enrichment of monocyte and microglia-derived macrophages within the SHH subgroup which they suggest may accumulate following radiation therapy [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108917].
Expression and copy number analyses were used to demonstrate that _GPC2_ is a highly expressed and copy number gained immunotherapeutic target in ETMRs, medulloblastomas, choroid plexus carcinomas, H3 wildtype high-grade gliomas, as well as DMGs [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.06.451385].
This led Foster and colleagues to subsequently develop a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) directed against _GPC2_, for which they show preclinical efficacy in mouse models [@doi:10.1101/2021.07.06.451385].
Moreover, OpenPBTA has enabled a framework to support real-time integration of subjects as each was enrolled on the PNOC008 high-grade glioma clinical trial [@url:https://pnoc.us/clinical-trial/pnoc008/], allowing researchers and clinicians to link tumor biology to translational impact through clinical decision support during tumor board discussions.
Finally, as part of the the NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative, the OpenPBTA project was recently expanded into a pan-pediatric cancer effort (https://github.com/PediatricOpenTargets/OpenPedCan-analysis) to build the Molecular Targets Platform (https://moleculartargets.ccdi.cancer.gov/) in support of the RACE Act.
The OpenPBTA project has paved the way for collaborative, open, reproducible, and scalable analyses and we anticipate this foundational work will have limitless impact within the pediatric oncology community, ultimately leading to improved outcomes for children with cancer.

All code and processed data are openly available through GitHub, CAVATICA, and PedcBioPortal (see **STAR METHODS**).
