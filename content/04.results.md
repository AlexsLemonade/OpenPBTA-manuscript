### The Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas

This section will introduce the dataset (e.g., the histologies represented and what data types are included; Figure {@fig:openpbta-overview}A-B) and the process for contributing analytical code and to the manuscript (Figure {@fig:openpbta-overview}C-D).

![An overview of the OpenPBTA project.
A) The distribution of unique participant samples across short histologies and integrated diagnoses.

### Landscape of Genomic Alterations

The oncoprint will provide a visualization of the genomic alterations found in the analyses implemented throughout the OpenPBTA project.

### Landscape of Mutational Processes

This section summarizes the mutational landscape of the pediatric brain tumor samples of this dataset.
Figure {@fig:openpbta-overview}A shows the tumor mutation burden as compared to adult TCGA brain-related tumors.
Figure {@fig:mutational-landscape-overview}B-C show concordance of these samples with mutational signatures from COSMIC [@url:https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic] and Alexandrov et al, 2013 [@doi:10.1038/nature12477] signature sets.

### Copy Number Variant Overview

![This figure shows dominant statuses for small copy number consensus segments (< 10 Mb) across the genome, where each square represents a ~1 Mb binned section of the genome.
A dominant status is declared if one status is >75% coverage.
Unstable indicates multiple non-neutral statuses totaling coverage >75%.
The large copy number segments larger than 10 Mb have been removed from the figure for easier interpretability.](https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/raw/master/figures/pngs/cn_status_heatmap.png){#fig:copy-number-status-heatmap width="7in"}

### Recurrence and co-occurrence of mutations

This section will discuss the genes and regions that are repeatedly mutated within and between cancer types.
The occurrence of mutations in affecting particular genes, separated by tumor type is shown in Figure {@fig:occurrence-plots}A, with significant co-occurrence across all types illustrated in Figure {@fig:occurrence-plots}B.

![Occurrence and co-occurrence of nonsynonymous mutations for the 50 most commonly mutated genes across all tumor types.
A) Counts of nonsynonymous mutations, colored by tumor type (as defined in `integrated_diagnosis`).
B) Co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity of nonsynonymous mutations between genes.
The co-occurrence score is defined as $I(-\log_{10}(P))$ where $P$ is defined by Fisher's exact test and $I$ is 1 when mutations co-occur more often than expected and -1 when exclusivity is more common.
