## Results

### Crowd-sourced Somatic Analysis to create an Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas

We previously performed whole genome sequencing (WGS), whole exome sequencing (WXS), and RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) on matched tumor and normal tissues as well as selected cell lines from 943 patients from the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (PBTA) [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noz192], consisting of samples from the [Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN)](https://CBTN.org) and the PNOC003 DMG clinical trial [@doi:10.1002/ijc.32258] of the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC) (**Figure {@fig:Fig1}A**).
We then harnessed the benchmarking efforts of the Kids First Data Resource Center to develop robust and reproducible data analysis workflows within the CAVATICA platform to perform primary somatic analyses including calling of single nucleotide variants (SNVs), copy number variants (CNVs), structural variants (SVs), and gene fusions, often implementing multiple complementary methods  (**Figure {@fig:S1}**) and **STAR Methods**).

To facilitate analysis and visualization of this large, diverse cohort, we further categorized tumor broad histologies (i.e., broad 2016 WHO classifications) into smaller groupings we denote "cancer groups."
A summarized view of the number of biospecimens per phase of therapy across different broad histologies and cancer groups is shown in (**Figure {@fig:Fig1}B**).
We maintained a data release folder on Amazon S3, downloadable directly from S3 or through the open-access [CAVATICA project](https://www.cavatica.org/), with merged files for each analysis (See **Data and code availability** section).
As new analytical results (e.g., tumor mutation burden calculations) that we expected to be used across multiple analyses were produced, or issues with the data were identified, new data releases were made available in a versioned manner.

A key innovative feature of this project has been its open contribution model used for both analyses (i.e., analytical code) and scientific manuscript writing.
We created a public Github analysis repository (https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis) to hold all code associated with analyses downstream of the Kids First Data Resource Center workflows and a GitHub manuscript repository (https://github.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-manuscript) with ManuBot [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128] integration to enable real-time manuscript creation using Markdown within GitHub.
Importantly, all analyses and manuscript writing were conducted openly throughout the research project, allowing any researcher in the world the opportunity to contribute.

The process for analysis and manuscript contributions is outlined in **Figure {@fig:Fig1}C**.
First, a potential contributor would propose an analysis by filing an issue in the GitHub analysis repository.
Next, organizers for the project, or other contributors with expertise, had the opportunity to provide feedback about the proposed analysis (**Figure {@fig:Fig1}C**).
The contributor then made a copy (fork) of the analysis repository and added their proposed analysis code and results to their fork.
The contributor would formally request to include their analytical code and results to the main OpenPBTA analysis repository by filing a pull request on GitHub.
All pull requests to the analysis repository underwent peer review by organizers and/or other contributors to ensure scientific accuracy, maintainability, and readability of code and  documentation (**Figure {@fig:Fig1}C-D**).

The collaborative nature of the project required additional steps beyond peer review of analytical code to ensure consistent results for all collaborators and over time (**Figure {@fig:Fig1}D**).
We leveraged Docker® and the Rocker project [@arxiv:1710.03675] to maintain a consistent software development environment, creating a monolithic image that contained all dependencies necessary for analyses.
To ensure that new code would execute in the development environment, we used the continuous integration (CI) service CircleCI® to run analytical code on a small subset of data for testing before formal code review, allowing us to detect code bugs or sensitivity to changes in the underlying data.

We followed a similar process in our Manubot-powered [@doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1007128] manuscript repository for additions to the manuscript (**Figure {@fig:Fig1}C**).
Contributors forked the manuscript repository, added proposed content to their branch, and filed pull requests to the main manuscript repository with their changes.
Similarly, pull requests underwent a peer review process for clarity and correctness, agreement with interpretation, and spell checking via Manubot.

### Molecular Subtyping of OpenPBTA CNS Tumors

Over the past two decades, experts in neuro-oncology have worked with the World Health Organization (WHO) to iteratively redefine the classifications of central nervous system (CNS) tumors [@doi:10.1093/jnen/61.3.215; @doi:10.1007/s00401-007-0243-4].
More recently, in 2016 and 2021 [@doi:10.1007/s00401-016-1545-1; @doi:10.1093/neuonc/noab106], molecular subtypes have been integrated into these classifications.
In 2011, the Children’s Brain Tumor Tissue Consortium, now known as the Children’s Brain Tumor Network (CBTN), opened its protocol for brain tumor and matched normal sample collection.
Since the CBTN opened its protocol before molecular data were integrated into classifications, the majority of the samples within the OpenPBTA lacked molecular subtype annotations.
Moreover, the OpenPBTA data does not feature methylation arrays which are now commonly used to perform molecular subtyping.
Therefore, we jointly considered key genomic features of tumor entities described by the WHO in 2016, low-grade glioma (LGG) subtypes described by Ryall and colleagues [@doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2020.03.011], as well as clinician and pathologist review to generate research-grade integrated diagnoses for 59% (630/1074) of tumor samples with high confidence (**Table S1**). <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->

Importantly, this collaborative molecular subtyping process allowed us to identify data entry errors (e.g., an ETMR incorrectly entered as a medulloblastoma) and mis-identified specimens (e.g., Ewing sarcoma sample labeled as a craniopharyngioma), update diagnoses using current WHO terms (e.g., tumors formerly ascribed primitive neuro-ectodermal tumor [PNET] diagnoses), and discover rarer tumor entities within the OpenPBTA (e.g., H3-mutant ependymoma, meningioma with _YAP1::FAM118B_ fusion).
<!--TODO: Update counts below when table is updated-->
**Table {@tbl:Table1}** lists the subtypes we defined within the OpenPBTA, comprising of LGATs (low grade astrocytic tumors; N = 569), high-grade gliomas (N = 314), embryonal tumors (N = 229), ependymomas (N = 65), tumors of sellar region (N = 51), mesenchymal non-meningothelial tumors (N = 21), glialneuronal tumors (N = 20), and chordomas (N = 12). <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->

Table: **Molecular subtypes generated through the OpenPBTA project.** Listed are broad tumor histologies, molecular subtypes generated, and number of specimens subtyped within the OpenPBTA project. {#tbl:Table1}

### Somatic Mutational Landscape of Pediatric Brain Tumors

We performed a comprehensive genomic analysis of somatic SNVs, CNVs, SVs, and fusions across 1,043 tumors (N = 1,019 RNA-Seq, N = 918 WGS, N = 32 WXS/Panel) and 22 cell lines (N = 16 RNA-Seq, N = 22 WGS), from 943 patients, 833 with paired normal specimens (N = 801 WGS, N = 32 WXS/Panel). <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
Following SNV consensus calling (**Figure {@fig:S1}** and **Figure {@fig:S2}A-G**), we observed lower expected tumor mutation burden (TMB) **Figure {@fig:S2}H** in pediatric tumors compared to adult brain tumors from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), **Figure {@fig:S2}I**, with hypermutant (> 10 Mut/Mb) and ultra-hypermutant (> 100 Mut/Mb) tumors [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2017.09.048] only found within HGGs.

<!-- TODO: Update group-specific count numbers below with figure update -->
#### Low-grade astrocytic tumors
**Figure {@fig:Fig2}A** depicts an oncoprint of driver genes for 227 primary low-grade astrocytic tumors. As expected, the majority (62%, 140/227) of these tumors harbored a somatic alteration in _BRAF_, with canonical _BRAF::KIAA1549_ fusions as the major oncogenic driver [@doi:10.1186/s40478-020-00902-z]. <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
We observed additional mutations in _FGFR1_ (2%), _PIK3CA_ (2%), _KRAS_ (2%), _TP53_ (1%), and _ATRX_ (1%) and fusions in _NTRK2_ (2%), _RAF1_ (2%), _MYB_ (1%), _QKI_ (1%), _ROS1_ (1%), and _FGFR2_ (1%), concordant with previous studies reporting the near universal upregulation of the RAS/MAPK pathway in these tumors resulting from activating mutations and/or oncogenic fusions [@doi:10.1186/s40478-020-00902-z; @doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2020.03.011].
Indeed, we observed significant upregulation (ANOVA p < 0.01) of the KRAS signaling pathway in LGATs (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}B**).

#### Embryonal tumors
**Figure {@fig:Fig2}B** shows the mutational landscape for 128 primary embryonal tumors. <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
The majority (N = 95) of samples were medulloblastomas that spanned the spectrum of molecular subtypes (WNT, SHH, Group3, and Group 4; see **Molecular Subtyping of CNS Tumors**), as identified by subtype-specific canonical mutations.
We detected canonical _SMARCB1/SMARCA4_ deletions or inactivating mutations in atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumors (ATRTs) and C19MC amplification in the embryonal tumors with multilayer rosettes (ETMRs) [@doi:10.1007/s00401-020-02182-2; @doi:10.1093/neuonc/noab178; @doi:10.1186/s40478-020-00984-9; @doi:10.1038/nature22973].

#### Diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors
In **Figure {@fig:Fig2}C**, we show genomic alterations in 61 HGGs biopsied at diagnosis: diffuse midline gliomas (DMGs, N = 34) and non-midline high-grade gliomas (HGGs, N = 26). <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
The single oligodendroglioma sample (N = 1) in the OpenPBTA does not contain mutations in the listed genes and is therefore not shown in this oncoprint.
Across diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors, we found that _TP53_ (57%, 35/61) and _H3F3A_ (52%, 32/61) were both most mutated and co-occurring genes (**Figure {@fig:Fig2}A**), followed by frequent mutations in _ATRX_ (30%, 18/61).
We found recurrent amplifications and fusions in _EGFR_, _MET_, _PDGFRA_, and _KIT_, highlighting that these tumors utilize multiple oncogenic mechanisms to activate tyrosine kinases, as has been previously reported [@doi:10.1002/ijc.32258; @doi:10.1016/j.ccell.2017.08.017; @doi:10.1186/s40478-020-00905-w].
Gene set enrichment analysis showed upregulation (ANOVA Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.01) of DNA repair, G2M checkpoint, and MYC pathways as well as downregulation of the TP53 pathway (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}B**).
The two tumors with ultra-high TMB (> 100 Mutations/Mb) were from patients with known mismatch repair deficiency syndrome [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noz192].

#### Other CNS tumors
**Figure {@fig:Fig2}D** depicts an oncoprint for the remaining primary CNS tumors in the OpenPBTA (N = 195). <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
We observed that 25% (15/60) of ependymoma tumors were _C11orf95::RELA_ (now, _ZFTA::RELA_) fusion-positive ependymomas and that 70% (21/30) of craniopharyngiomas were driven by mutations in _CTNNB1_.
Multiple histologies contained somatic mutations or fusions in _NF2_: 41% (7/17) of meningiomas, 5% (3/60) of ependymomas,  and 27% (3/11) schwannomas.
Rare fusions in _ERBB4_, _YAP1_, _KRAS_, and _MAML2_ were observed in 10% (6/60) of ependymoma tumors.
DNETs harbored alterations in MAPK/PI3K pathway genes as previously reported [@doi:10.1093/jnen/nlz101], including _FGFR1_ (21%, 4/19), _PDGFRA_ (10%, 2/19), and _BRAF_ (5%, 1/19).

<!--SAMPLECOUNT-->


### Mutational co-occurrence, CNV and signatures highlight key oncogenic drivers


We analyzed mutational co-occurrence among OpenPBTA tumors, using a single sequencing sample from each individual with available WGS (N = 666). <!--SAMPLECOUNT-->
The top 50 mutated genes (see **STAR Methods** for details) in primary tumors are shown in **Figure {@fig:Fig3}** by tumor type (**A**, bar plots), with co-occurrence scores illustrated in the heatmap (**B**).
_TP53_ was the most frequently mutated gene across OpenPBTA tumors (8.4%, 56/666), significantly co-occurring with _H3F3A_ (OR = 32, 95% CI: 15.3 - 66.7, q = 8.46e-17), _ATRX_ (OR = 20, 95% CI: 8.4 - 47.7, q = 4.43e-8), _NF1_ (OR = 8.62, 95% CI: 3.7 - 20.2, q = 5.45e-5), and _EGFR_ (OR = 18.2, 95% CI: 5 - 66.5, q = 1.6e-4).
Other canonical cancer driver genes that were frequently mutated included _BRAF_, _H3F3A_, _CTNNB1_, _NF1_, _ATRX_, _FGFR1_, and _PIK3CA_.

At the broad histology level, _CTNNB1_ significantly co-occurred with _TP53_ (OR = 42.9, 95% CI: 7 - 261.4, q = 1.63e-3) and _DDX3X_ (OR = 21.1, 95% CI: 4.6 - 96.3, q = 4.46e-3) in embryonal tumors. _FGFR1_ and _PIK3CA_ significantly co-occur in LGGs (OR = 76.1, 95% CI: 9.85 - 588.1, q = 3.26e-3), consistent with previous findings [@doi:10.1200/JCO.2010.31.1670; @doi:10.1186/s40478-020-01027-z].
Of HGG tumors with mutations in _TP53_ or _PPM1D_, 52/54 (96.3%) had mutations in only one of these genes (OR = 0.188, 95% CI: 0.04 - 0.94, p = 0.0413, q = 0.0587).
This trend recapitulates previous observations that _TP53_ and _PPM1D_ mutations tend to be mutually exclusive in HGGs [@doi:10.1038/ng.2938].

We summarized broad CNV and SV and observed that HGGs and DMGs, followed by medulloblastomas, had the most unstable genomes (**Figure {@fig:S3}A**).
By contrast, craniopharyngiomas and schwannomas generally lacked somatic CNV.
Together, these CNV patterns largely aligned with our estimates of tumor mutational burden (**Figure {@fig:S2}H**).
The number of SV and CNV breakpoints were significantly correlated across tumors (p = 1.08e-37) (**Figure {@fig:Fig3}C**) and as expected, the number of chromothripsis regions called increased as breakpoint density increased (**Figure {@fig:S3}B-C**).
We identified chromothripsis events in 41% (N = 19/46) of non-midline high-grade gliomas (high-grade glioma astrocytomas) and in 28.2% (N = 11/39) of diffuse midline gliomas (**Figure {@fig:Fig3}D**).
We also found evidence of chromothripsis in over 15% of sarcomas, metastatic secondary tumors, embryonal tumors, chordomas, glial-neuronal tumors, germinomas, meningiomas, and ependymomas, highlighting the genomic instability and complexity of these pediatric brain tumors.

We next assessed the contributions of eight previously identified adult CNS-specific mutational signatures from the RefSig database [@doi:10.1038/s43018-020-0027-5] across samples (**Figure {@fig:Fig3}E** and **Figure {@fig:S4}A**).
Stage 0 and/or 1 tumors characterized by low TMBs (**Figure {@fig:S2}G**) such as LGGs, gangliogliomas, craniopharyngiomas, DNETs, and schwannomas were dominated by Signature 1, which results from the normal process of spontaneous deamination of 5-methylcytosine.
Signature N6 is a CNS-specific signature which we observed nearly universally across samples.
Drivers of Signature 18, _TP53_, _APC_, _NOTCH1_ (found at https://signal.mutationalsignatures.com/explore/referenceCancerSignature/31/drivers), are also canonical drivers of medulloblastoma, and indeed, we observed Signature 18 as the most common signature in medulloblastoma tumors.
Signatures 3, 8, 18, and MMR2 were prevalent in HGGs, including DMGs.
Finally, we found that the Signature 1 weight was higher at diagnosis (pre-treatment) and was almost always lower in tumors at later phases of therapy (progression, recurrence, post-mortem, secondary malignancy; **Figure {@fig:S4}B**).
This trend may have resulted from therapy-induced mutations that produced additional signatures (e.g., temozolomide treatment has been suggested to drive Signature 11 [@doi:1053/j.gastro.2014.07.052]), subclonal expansion, and/or acquisition of additional driver mutations during tumor progression, leading to higher overall TMBs and additional signatures.

### Transcriptomic Landscape of Pediatric Brain Tumors

#### Prediction of _TP53_ oncogenicity and telomerase activity

To understand the _TP53_ phenotype in each tumor, we ran a classifier previously trained on TCGA [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076] to calculate a _TP53_ score and infer _TP53_ inactivation status.
We compared results of this classifier to "true positive" alterations derived using high-confidence SNVs, CNVs, SVs, and fusions in _TP53_.
Specifically, we annotated _TP53_ alterations as "activated" if samples harbored one of p.R273C or p.R248W mutations [@doi:10.1038/ng0593-42], or "lost" if the given patient either had a Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) predisposition diagnosis, the tumor harbored a known hotspot mutation, or the tumor contained two hits (e.g. both SNV and CNV), which would suggest both alleles had been affected.
If the _TP53_ mutation did not reside within the DNA-binding domain or we did not detect any alteration in _TP53_, we annotate the tumor as "other," reflecting its unknown _TP53_ alteration status.
The classifier achieved a high accuracy (AUROC = 0.85) for rRNA-depleted, stranded samples compared to randomly shuffled _TP53_ scores (**Figure {@fig:Fig4}A**).
By contrast, while this classifier has previously shown strong performance on poly-A data from both adult [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076] tumors and pediatric patient-derived xenografts [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2019.09.071], it did not perform as well on the poly-A samples in this cohort (AUROC = 0.62; **Figure {@fig:S5}A**).

While we expected that samples annotated as "lost" would have higher _TP53_ scores than would samples annotated as "other," we observed that samples annotated as "activated" had similar _TP53_ scores to those annotated as "lost" (**Figure {@fig:Fig4}B**, Wilcoxon p = 0.23).
This result suggests that the classifier actually detects an oncogenic, or altered, _TP53_ phenotype (scores > 0.5) rather than solely _TP53_ inactivation, as interpreted previously [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076].
Moreover, tumors with "activating" _TP53_ mutations had evidence of higher _TP53_ expression compared to those with _TP53_ "loss" mutations (Wilcoxon p = 3.5e-3, **Figure {@fig:Fig4}C**).
Tumor types with the highest median _TP53_ scores were those known to harbor somatic _TP53_ alterations and included DMGs, medulloblastomas, HGGs, DNETs, ependymomas, and craniopharyngiomas (**Figure {@fig:Fig4}D**), while gangliogliomas, LGGs, meningiomas, and schwannomas had the lowest median scores.

To further validate the classifier's accuracy, we assessed _TP53_ scores for patients with LFS, hypothesizing that all of these tumors would have high scores.
Indeed, we observed higher scores in LFS tumors (N = 8) for which we detected high-confidence _TP53_ somatic alterations (**Tables S1 and S3**).
Although we did not detect canonical somatic _TP53_ mutations in two LFS patient tumors with low _TP53_ scores (BS_DEHJF4C7 with a score of 0.09 and BS_ZD5HN296 with a score of 0.28), we confirmed the LFS diagnoses from pathology reports and noted that patient had a pathogenic germline variant in _TP53_.
In addition, the tumor purity of these two LFS samples was low (16% and 37%, respectively), suggesting the classifier may require a certain level of tumor purity to achieve good performance, as we expect _TP53_ to be intact in normal cells.


We next used gene expression data to predict telomerase activity using EXpression-based Telomerase ENzymatic activity Detection (EXTEND) [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20474-9] as a surrogate measure of malignant potential [@doi:10.1038/s41467-020-20474-9; @doi:10.1093/carcin/bgp268], such that higher EXTEND scores suggest increase malignant potential.
As expected, EXTEND scores significantly correlated with _TERC_ (R = 0.619, p < 0.01) and _TERT_ (R = 0.491, p < 0.01) expression (**Figure {@fig:S5}B-C**).
We found aggressive tumors such as HGGs (DMGs and other high-grade gliomas) and MB had high EXTEND scores (**Figure {@fig:Fig4}D**), while benign lesions such as schwannomas, GNGs, DNETs, and other low-grade gliomas had among the lowest scores (**Table S3**).
These findings support previous reports of a more aggressive phenotype in tumors with higher telomerase activity	[@doi:10.1007/s13277-016-5045-7; @doi:10.1038/labinvest.3700710; @doi:10.1007/s12032-016-0736-x; @doi:10.1111/j.1750-3639.2010.00372.x].


#### Hypermutant tumors share mutational signatures and have dysregulated **_TP53_**


We further investigated the mutational signature profiles of the hypermutant (TMB > 10 Mut/Mb; N = 2) and ultra-hypermutant (TMB > 100 Mut/Mb; N = 4) HGG tumors and/or derived cell lines from five patients in the OpenPBTA cohort (**Figure {@fig:Fig4}E**).
Signature 11, which has been suggested to result from exposure to temozolomide, was indeed present in tumors with previous exposure to the drug (**Table {@tbl:Table2}**).
We detected the MMR2 signature in tumors of four patients (PT_0SPKM4S8, PT_3CHB9PK5, PT_JNEV57VK, and PT_VTM2STE3) diagnosed with Lynch syndrome (**Table {@tbl:Table2}**), a genetic predisposition syndrome caused by a variant in a mismatch repair gene such as _PMS2_, _MLH1_, _MSH2_, _MSH6_, or others [@doi:10.3390/genes5030497].
Interestingly, while the cell line derived from patient PT_VTM2STE3's tumor at progression was not hypermutated (TMB = 5.74 Mut/Mb), it solely showed the MMR2 signature of the eight CNS signatures examined, suggesting selective pressure to maintain a mismatch repair (MMR) phenotype _in vitro_.
From patient PT_JNEV57VK, only one of the two cell lines derived from the progressive tumor was hypermutated (TMB = 35.9 Mut/Mb).
This hypermutated cell line was strongly weighted towards signature 11, while this patient's non-hypermutated cell line showed a number of lesser signature weights (1, 11, 18, 19, MMR2), highlighting the plasticity of mutational processes and the need to carefully genomically characterize and select models for preclinical studies based on research objectives.

We observed that signature 18, which has been associated with high genomic instability and can lead to a hypermutator phenotype [@doi:10.1038/s43018-020-0027-5], was uniformly represented among hypermutant solid tumors.
Additionally, we found that all of these tumor or cell lines had dysfunctional _TP53_ (**Table {@tbl:Table2}**), consistent with a previous report showing _TP53_ dysregulation is a dependency in tumors with high genomic instability [@doi:10.1038/s43018-020-0027-5].
With one exception, hypermutant and ultra-hypermutant tumors had high  _TP53_ scores (> 0.5) and telomerase activity.
Interestingly, none of the hypermutant samples showed evidence of signature 3 (present in homologous recombination deficient tumors), signature 8 (arises from double nucleotide substitutions/unknown etiology), or signature N6 (a universal CNS tumor signature).
The mutual exclusivity of signatures 3 and MMR2 corroborates a previous report suggesting tumors do not tend to feature both deficient homologous repair and mismatch repair [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2018.03.076].

Next, we asked whether transcriptomic classification of _TP53_ dysregulation and/or telomerase activity recapitulate the known prognostic influence of these oncogenic biomarkers.
To this end, we conducted a multivariate cox regression on overall survival (**Figure {@fig:Fig4}F**; **STAR Methods**), controlling for extent of tumor resection and whether a tumor was low-grade (LGG group) or high-grade (HGG group).
We identified several expected trends, including a significant overall survival benefit if the tumor had been fully resected (HR = 0.36, 95% CI = 0.2 - 0.67, p = 0.001) or if the tumor belonged to the LGG group (HR = 0.068, 95% CI = 0.0091 - 0.5, p = 0.008) as well as a significant risk if the tumor belonged to the HGG group (HR = 5.7, 95% CI = 3.5 - 9.0, p < 0.001).
High telomerase scores were a poor prognostic indicator across brain tumor histologies (HR = 24, 95% CI = 7.1 - 79, p < 0.001), demonstrating that EXTEND scores calculated from RNA-Seq are an effective rapid surrogate measure for telomerase activity.
Although higher _TP53_ scores, which predict _TP53_ gene or pathway dysregulation, were not a significant predictor of risk across the entire OpenPBTA cohort (**Table S4**), we did find a significant survival risk for both DMGs (HR = 1.77e6, 95% CI = 1.98-1.57e12, p = 0.04) and ependymomas (HR = 1612, 95 % CI = 9.1-2.9e5, p = 0.005).
Since we observed the negative prognostic effect of _TP53_ scores for HGGs, we assessed the effect of molecular subtypes within HGG samples on survival risk.
We found that DMG H3 K28 tumors with _TP53_ loss had significantly worse prognosis (HR = 3.2, CI = 1.5-6.6, p = 0.002) than did DMG H3 K28 tumors with wildtype _TP53_ (**Figure {@fig:Fig4}G** and **Figure {@fig:Fig4}H**).

#### Histologic and oncogenic pathway clustering

UMAP visualization of gene expression variation across brain tumors (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}A**) showed the expected clustering of brain tumors by histology.
We additionally explored UMAP projections of gene expression within molecular subtypes for certain cancer groups.
We observed that, except for three outliers, _C11orf95::RELA_ (_ZFTA::RELA_) fusion-positive ependymomas fell within distinct clusters (**Figure {@fig:S6}A**).
Medulloblastoma (MB) samples cluster by molecular subtype, with WNT and SHH in distinct clusters and Groups 3 and 4 showing some overlap (**Figure {@fig:S6}B**), as expected.
Of note, two MB samples annotated as the SHH subtype did not cluster with the other MB samples, and one clustered with Group 3 and 4 samples, suggesting potential subtype misclassification or different underlying biology of these two tumors.
_BRAF_-driven low-grade gliomas (**Figure {@fig:S6}C**) were present in three separate clusters, suggesting that there might be additional shared biology within each cluster.
Histone H3 G35-mutant high-grade gliomas generally clustered together and away from K28-mutant tumors (**Figure {@fig:S6}D**).
Interestingly, although H3 K28-mutant tumors have different biological drivers than do H3 wildtype tumors [@doi:10.1126/science.1232245], they did not form distinct clusters.
This pattern suggests these subtypes may be driven by common transcriptional programs, have other much stronger biological drivers than their known distinct epigenetic drivers, or our sample size is too small to detect transcriptional differences.

We next performed gene set variant analysis (GSVA) for Hallmark cancer gene sets to demonstrate activation of underlying oncogenic pathways (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}B** and quantified immune cell fractions across OpenPBTA tumors using quanTIseq (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}C** and **Figure {@fig:S6}E**).
Through these analyses, we were able to recapitulate previously-described tumor biology.
For example, HGG, DMG, MB, and ATRT tumors are known to upregulate _MYC_ [@doi:10.3390/genes8040107] which in turn activates _E2F_ and S phase [@pmid:11511364].
Indeed, we detected significant (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05) upregulation of _MYC_ and _E2F_ targets, as well as G2M (cell cycle phase following S phase) in both embryonal and diffuse astrocytic and oligodendroglial tumors compared to several other cancer groups.
In contrast, low-grade astrocytic tumors showed significant downregulation (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05) of these pathways.
Schwannomas and neurofibromas, which have a documented inflammatory immune microenvironment of T and B lymphocytes as well as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), are driven by upregulation of cytokines such as IFN$\gamma$, IL-1, and IL-6, and TNF$\alpha$ [@doi:10.1093/noajnl/vdaa023].
Indeed, we observed significant upregulation of these cytokines in GSVA hallmark pathways (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05) (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}B**) and found immune cell types dominated by monocytes in these tumors (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}C**).
We also observed significant upregulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines IFN$\alpha$ and IFN$\gamma$ in LGG and craniopharyngiomas compared to medulloblastoma and ependymoma tumors (Bonferroni-corrected p < 0.05), both of which showed significant down-regulation of these cytokines (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}B**).
Together, these results supported previous proteogenomic findings of lower immune infiltration in aggressive medulloblastomas and ependymomas versus higher immune infiltration in _BRAF_-driven LGG and craniopharyngiomas [@doi:10.1016/j.cell.2020.10.044].


Although CD8+ T-cell infiltration across all cancer groups was quite low (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}C**), we observed some signal in specific cancer molecular subtypes (medulloblastoma Groups 3 and 4) as well as outlier tumors (BRAF-driven LGG, BRAF-driven and wildtype ganglioglioma, H3 wildtype HGG; **Figure {@fig:S6}E**)
Surprisingly, the classically immunologically-cold HGG and DMG tumors [@doi:10.1186/s40478-018-0553-x; @doi:10.1093/brain/awab155] contained higher overall fractions of immune cells, where monocytes, dendritic cells, and NK cells were the most prevalent (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}C**).
Thus, we suspect that quanTIseq might actually have captured microglia within these immune cell fractions.

While we did not detect notable prognostic effects of immune cell infiltration in HGG or DMG tumors, we did find that high levels of macrophage M1 and monocytes were associated with poorer overall survival (monocyte HR = 5.2e17, 95% CI = 1.2e5 - 2.3e30, p = 0.006) in medulloblastoma tumors (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}D**).
We further reproduced previous findings (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}E**) that medulloblastomas typically have low expression of _CD274_ (PD-L1) [@doi:10.18632/oncotarget.24951].
However, we also found that higher expression of _CD274_ was significantly associated with improved overall prognosis for medulloblastoma samples, although with a marginal effect size (HR = 0.00074, 95% CI = 3.0e-6 - 0.18, p = 0.01) (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}D**).
This result may be explained by the higher expression of _CD274_ found in WNT subtype tumors by us and others [@doi:10.1080/2162402X.2018.1462430], as this diagnosis carries the best prognosis of all medulloblastoma subgroups (**Figure {@fig:Fig5}E**).

Finally, we asked whether any molecular subtypes might show an immunologically-hot phenotype, as roughly defined by a greater proportion of CD8+ to CD4+ T cells [@doi:10.1136/jitc-2021-004012; @doi:10.4236/jct.2013.48164].
While Group 3 and Group 4 medulloblastomas had the highest ratios (**Figure {@fig:S6}F**), very few tumors had ratios greater than 1, highlighting an urgent need to identify novel therapeutics for these immunologically-cold pediatric brain tumors with poor prognosis.
