### Spellcheck Step

The dictionary used for spellchecking can be updated.
Edit the file in `build/assets/custom-dictionary.txt` by adding new entries to the end.
You do not need to change anything else.
However, if you want to update the first line to have an accurate count of words and you want to remove non-unique ones, run the following command from within `build/assets` on your favorite OS X or Linux machine:
```
(( len = $(awk '!a[$0]++' < custom-dictionary.txt | wc -l ) - 1 )); tmpfile="$(mktemp)"; echo "personal_ws-1.1 en $len utf-8" > $tmpfile; tail -n +2 custom-dictionary.txt | awk '!a[$0]++' >> $tmpfile; mv $tmpfile custom-dictionary.txt
```
