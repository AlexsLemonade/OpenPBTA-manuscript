## Supplemental Information Titles and Legends
<!-- TODO: Add complete legends once figures are finalized. -->

**Figure S1. OpenPBTA Project Workflow, Related to Figure 1.** 
Biospecimens and data were collected by CBTN and PNOC. 
Genomic sequencing and harmonization (orange boxes) were performed by the Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC). 
Analyses in the green boxes were performed by contributors of the OpenPBTA project. 
Output files are denoted in blue. 
Figure created with biorender.com.

Correlation (A) and violin (B) plots of mutation variant allele frequencies (VAFs) comparing the variant callers (Lancet, Strelka2, Mutect2, and VarDict) used for PBTA samples. 
Upset plot (C) showing overlap of variant calls. Correlation (D) and violin (E) plots of mutation variant allele frequencies (VAFs) comparing the variant callers (Lancet, Strelka2, and Mutect2) used for TCGA samples. 
Upset plot (F) showing overlap of variant calls. Cumulative distribution TMB plots (G) for PBTA and TCGA tumors using consensus SNV calls.
