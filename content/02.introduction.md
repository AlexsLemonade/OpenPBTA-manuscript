## Introduction

Pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors are collectively the second most common malignancy in children after leukemia, representing the leading disease-related cause of death in children [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noz150].
Five-year survival rates vary widely across different histologic and molecular classifications of brain tumors.
For example, most high-grade gliomas carry a universally fatal prognosis, while children with pilocytic astrocytoma have an estimated 10-year survival rate of 92% [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/now207].
Moreover, recent estimates suggest that children and adolescents aged 0-19 with brain tumors in the United States lose an average 47,631 years of life [@doi:10.1002/cam4.410].

The low survival rates for some pediatric tumors are clearly multifactorial, explained partly by our lack of comprehensive understanding of the ever-evolving array of brain tumor molecular subtypes, difficulty drugging these tumors, and the shortage of drugs specifically labeled for pediatric malignancies.
Historically, some of the most fatal, inoperable brain tumors, such as diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), were not routinely biopsied due to perceived risks of biopsy and the paucity of therapeutic options.
Thus, limited access to tissue for development of patient-derived cell lines and mouse models has been a barrier to research.
Furthermore, the incidence of any single brain tumor molecular subtype is relatively low due to the rarity of pediatric tumors in general.

To address these long-standing barriers, multiple national and international consortia have come together to uniformly collect clinically-annotated surgical biosamples and associated germline materials as part of both observational and interventional clinical trials.  
Such accessible, centralized resources enable collaborative sharing of specimens and data across rare cancer subtypes to accelerate breakthroughs and clinical translation. 
The creation of the Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas (PBTA) in 2018, led by the Children's Brain Tumor Network (CBTN, cbtn.org)[@doi:10.1016/j.neo.2022.100846] and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium (PNOC, pnoc.us), is one such effort that builds upon 12 years of multi-institutional enrollment, sample collection, and clinical followup across more than 30 institutions.
Just as cooperation is required to share specimens and data, rigorous cancer genomic analysis requires collaboration among researchers with distinct expertise, such as computational scientists, bench scientists, clinicians, and pathologists.

Although there has been significant progress to elucidate the landscape of somatic variation responsible for pediatric brain tumor formation and progression, translation of therapeutic agents to phase II or III clinical trials and subsequent FDA approvals have not kept pace.
Within the last 20 years, the FDA has approved only seven targeted agents which can be used to treat pediatric brain tumors: mTOR inhibitor everolimus, for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma; anti-PD-1 immunotherapy pembrolizumab, for microsatellite instability–high or mismatch repair–deficient tumors; NTRK inhibitors larotrectinib and entrectinib, for tumors with an NTRK 1/2/3 gene fusions; MEK1/2 inhibitor selumetinib, for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas, and combination therapy MEK1/2 inhibitor trametinib and BRAF/CRAF inhibitor dabrafenib for unresectable or metastatic progressive tumors with BRAF V600E mutations [@url:https://www.fda.gov/about-fda/oncology-center-excellence/pediatric-oncology-drug-approvals].

This is, in part, due to pharmaceutical company priorities and concerns regarding toxicity, making it challenging for researchers to obtain to new therapeutic agents for pediatric clinical trials.
Critically, as of August 18, 2020, an amendment to the Pediatric Research Equity Act called the "Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act" mandates that all new adult oncology drugs also be tested in children when the molecular target exists in a childhood cancer.
The RACE Act, coupled with the identification of putative molecular targets in pediatric cancers through genomic characterization, is poised to accelerate identification of novel and effective therapeutic options for pediatric diseases that have otherwise been overlooked.

To leverage diverse scientific and analytical expertise to analyze the PBTA data, we created an open science model and incorporated features such as analytical code review [@doi:10.1093/aje/kwab092; @doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.3210v1] and continuous integration to test data and code [@doi:10.1038/nbt.3780; @doi:10.7287/peerj.preprints.3210v1] to improve reproducibility throughout the life cycle of our project, termed OpenPBTA.

We anticipated that a model of open collaboration would enhance the value of this resource for the pediatric brain tumor research community and provide a framework for continuous, accelerated translation of pediatric brain tumor datasets.
Openly sharing data and code in real time allows others to build upon the work more rapidly, and publications that include data and code sharing are poised for greater impact [@doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0000308; @doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1008867].
Here, we present a comprehensive, collaborative, open genomic analysis of 1,074 tumors and 22 cell lines, comprised of 58 distinct brain tumor histologies from 943 patients.
The data and containerized infrastructure of OpenPBTA have been instrumental for discovery and translational research studies [@doi:10.1016/j.celrep.2021.108917; @doi:10.1158/1078-0432.CCR-22-0803; @doi:10.1136/jitc-2021-004450; @doi:10.1093/neuonc/noac278], are actively integrated into PNOC molecular tumor board decision-making, and are a foundational layer for the NCI's Childhood Cancer Data Initiative's (CCDI) pediatric Molecular Targets Platform ([https://moleculartargets.ccdi.cancer.gov/](https://moleculartargets.ccdi.cancer.gov/)) recently built in support of the RACE Act [@doi:10.1158/2159-8290.CD-NB2020-081].
We anticipate OpenPBTA will be an invaluable resource to the pediatric oncology community.
