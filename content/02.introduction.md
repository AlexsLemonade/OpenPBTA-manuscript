## Introduction

Pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors are the second most common tumors in children after leukemia, yet they remain a leading cause of death by disease in children [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/noz150]. 
Five-year survival rates vary widely across different types and molecular classifications of brain tumors.
For example, most high-grade and embryonal tumors carry a universally fatal prognosis while children with pilocytic astrocytoma have an estimated 10-year survival rate of 92% [@doi:10.1093/neuonc/now207]. 
Despite their relative rarity, the years of potential life lost due to brain tumors in 2009 was estimated at 47,631 years for children and adolescents aged 0-19 in the United States [@doi:10.1159/00009389610.1159/000093896]. 
Low survival rates for some tumors can be explained in part by our lack of understanding of the ever-evolving array of brain tumor molecular subtypes, difficulty drugging these entities, and the shortage of drugs specifically labeled for pediatric malignancies. 
For decades, some of the most fatal, inoperable brain tumors, such as diffuse midline gliomas, were not routinely biopsied because their anatomical location in the brainstem and/or pons posed risk. 
Limited access to tissue to develop patient-derived cell line and mouse models has been a barrier to research. 
Furthermore, the incidence of any single molecular tumor entity is relatively low simply due to the rarity of pediatric tumors in general. 
Together, these factors have hindered research progress and have led to multiple national and international center and consortia efforts to collaboratively share specimens and data to accelerate breakthroughs and clinical translation. 

There has been significant progress in recent years to elucidate the landscape of somatic variation responsible for pediatric brain tumor formation and progression, however, translation of therapeutic agents to phase II or III clinical trials and subsequent FDA approval has been slow. 
Within the last 20 years, the FDA has approved only five drugs for the treatment of pediatric brain tumors: mTOR inhibitor, everolimus, for subependymal giant cell astrocytoma in 2012; anti-PD-1 immunotherapy, pembrolizumab, for microsatellite instability–high or mismatch repair–deficient tumors in 2017; NTRK inhibitors larotrectinib (2018) and entrectinib (2019) for tumors with an NTRK 1/2/3 gene fusions; MEK1/2 inhibitor, selumetinib, for neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and symptomatic, inoperable plexiform neurofibromas in 2020. 
This is, in part, due to pharmaceutical company priorities and/or concerns for toxicity resulting in an inability to obtain drugs for clinical trials in children and ultimately delayed access to new agents.
An amendment to the Pediatric Research Equity Act called the Research to Accelerate Cures and Equity (RACE) for Children Act mandates that as of August 18, 2020 all new adult oncology drugs also be tested in children when the molecular targets are relevant to a particular childhood cancer. 
Here, we present a comprehensive, collaborative, open genomic analysis of 943 patient tumors from 59 distinct brain tumor histologies which can be used to support the RACE Act and accelerate rational clinical trial design.
