![**Figure S1. OpenPBTA Project Workflow, Related to Figure 1.** Biospecimens and data were collected by CBTN and PNOC. Genomic sequencing and harmonization (orange boxes) were performed by the Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC). Analyses in the green boxes were performed by contributors of the OpenPBTA project. Output files are denoted in blue.

Validation of Consensus SNV calls and Tumor Mutation Burden, Related to Figures 2 and 3.** Correlation (A) and violin (B) plots of mutation variant allele frequencies (VAFs) comparing the variant callers (Lancet, Strelka2, Mutect2, and VarDict) used for PBTA samples. Upset plot (C) showing overlap of variant calls. Correlation (D) and violin (E) plots of mutation variant allele frequencies (VAFs) comparing the variant callers (Lancet, Strelka2, and Mutect2) used for TCGA samples. Upset plot (F) showing overlap of variant calls. Violin plots (G) showing VAFs for Lancet calls performed on WGS and WXS from the same tumor (N = 52 samples from 13 patients).

![**Figure S3. Genomic instability of pediatric brain tumors, Related to Figures 2 and 3.** (A) Oncoprint of canonical somatic gene mutations, CNVs, fusions, and TMB (top bar plot) for the top 20 genes mutated across rare CNS tumors (N < 5 each): desmoplastic infantile astrocytoma and ganglioglioma (N = 1), germinoma (N = 4), glial-neuronal NOS (N = 4), metastatic secondary tumors (N = 3), neurocytoma (N = 2), and pineoblastoma (N = 3). Patient sex (`germline_sex_estimate`) and tumor histology (`cancer_group`) are displayed as annotations at the bottom of each plot. Only primary tumors with mutations in the listed genes are shown. Multiple CNVs are denoted as a complex event. (B) Genome-wide plot of CNV alterations by broad histology. Each row represents one sample. Box and whisker plots of number of CNV breaks (C) or SV breaks (D) by number of chromothripsis regions.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AlexsLemonade/OpenPBTA-analysis/b78c63b52fe252ab26b3141272031d4c35504f6e/figures/pngs/figureS3.png?sanitize=true){#fig:S3 tag="S3" width="6in"}
