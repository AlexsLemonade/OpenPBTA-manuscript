    "abstract": "Pediatric brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer death in children with an urgent need for innovative therapies. Here we show that the cell surface oncoprotein glypican 2 (GPC2) is highly expressed on multiple lethal pediatric brain tumors, including medulloblastomas, embryonal tumors with multi-layered rosettes, other CNS embryonal tumors, as well as definable subsets of highly malignant gliomas. To target GPC2 on these pediatric brain tumors with adoptive cellular therapies and mitigate potential inflammatory neurotoxicity, we developed four mRNA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell constructs using the highly GPC2-specific fully human D3 single chain variable fragment. First, we validated and prioritized these CARs using in vitro cytotoxicity and T cell degranulation assays with GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma cells. Next, we expanded the testing of the two most potent GPC2-directed CAR constructs prioritized from these studies to GPC2-expressing medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma cell lines, showing significant GPC2-specific cell death in multiple models. Finally, locoregional delivery bi-weekly of two to four million GPC2-directed mRNA CAR T cells induced significant and sustained tumor regression in two orthotopic medulloblastoma models, and significantly prolonged survival in an aggressive orthotopic thalamic diffuse midline glioma model. No GPC2-directed CAR T cell related neurologic or systemic toxicity was observed. Taken together, these data show that GPC2 is a highly differentially expressed cell surface protein on multiple malignant pediatric brain tumors that can be targeted safely with local delivery of mRNA CAR T cells.One Sentence Summary Glypican 2 is expressed on the surface of multiple pediatric brain tumors and can be successfully targeted with mRNA chimeric antigen receptor T cells.Competing Interest StatementT.S. is currently employed by Spark Therapeutics.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive disease gene discovery in both common and rare diseases will require the efficient and accurate detection of all classes of genetic variation across tens to hundreds of thousands of human samples. We describe here a novel assembly-based approach to variant calling, the GATK HaplotypeCaller (HC) and Reference Confidence Model (RCM), that determines genotype likelihoods independently per-sample but performs joint calling across all samples within a project simultaneously. We show by calling over 90,000 samples from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) that, in contrast to other algorithms, the HC-RCM scales efficiently to very large sample sizes without loss in accuracy; and that the accuracy of indel variant calling is superior in comparison to other algorithms. More importantly, the HC-RCM produces a fully squared-off matrix of genotypes across all samples at every genomic position being investigated. The HC-RCM is a novel, scalable, assembly-based algorithm with abundant applications for population genetics and clinical studies.",

Assembly implies whole haplotypes and read pairs, rather than single bases, as the atomic units of biological variation and sequencing evidence, improving variant calling.

    "abstract": "Motivation Fusion genes created by genomic rearrangements can be potent drivers of tumorigenesis. However, accurate identification of functionally fusion genes from genomic sequencing requires whole genome sequencing, since exonic sequencing alone is often insufficient. Transcriptome sequencing provides a direct, highly effective alternative for capturing molecular evidence of expressed fusions in the precision medicine pipeline, but current methods tend to be inefficient or insufficiently accurate, lacking in sensitivity or predicting large numbers of false positives. Here, we describe STAR-Fusion, a method that is both fast and accurate in identifying fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data.\nResults We benchmarked STAR-Fusion‚Äôs fusion detection accuracy using both simulated and genuine Illumina paired-end RNA-Seq data, and show that it has superior performance compared to popular alternative fusion detection methods.\nAvailability and implementation STAR-Fusion is implemented in Perl, freely available as open source software at http://star-fusion.github.io, and supported on Linux.\nContact bhaas{at}broadinstitute.org",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations and proofs of statistical tests. The process of developing the technical artifact‚Äîthat is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable‚Äîis much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this paper I argue that it‚Äôs critical to teach analysts how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that their analysis is reproducible, accurate, and collaborative. A critical component of this is adopting a blameless postmortem culture. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, as well as a blameless way of correcting course as analysts encounter errors, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible.",

Diffuse PLGGs comprise a set of uncommon subtypes that exhibit invasive growth and are therefore especially challenging clinically. We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription factor\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas in the related gene\n            <jats:italic>v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog</jats:italic>\n            (\n            <jats:italic>MYB</jats:italic>\n            ) on 6q23.3.

Truncated\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional tumors with\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            partial duplication.

As an alignment post-pass, its own runtime overhead is negligible, while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and runtime.

Diffuse PLGGs comprise a set of uncommon subtypes that exhibit invasive growth and are therefore especially challenging clinically. We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription factor\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas in the related gene\n            <jats:italic>v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog</jats:italic>\n            (\n            <jats:italic>MYB</jats:italic>\n            ) on 6q23.3. Whole-genome sequencing of a\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            -rearranged diffuse astrocytoma grade II demonstrated\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            tandem duplication and few other events. Truncated\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional tumors with\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            partial duplication. Our results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n          </jats:p>",

All tumors tested showed loss of H3K27me3 staining, with evidence of overexpression of the EZH inhibitory protein (EZHIP) in the H3 wildtype cases. Although some tumors indeed showed a bithalamic growth pattern, a significant proportion of tumors occurred in the unilateral thalamus or in other (predominantly midline) locations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Our findings present a distinct molecular class of pediatric-type malignant gliomas largely overlapping with the recently reported bithalamic gliomas characterized by EGFR alteration, but additionally showing a broader spectrum of EGFR alterations and tumor localization.

    "abstract": "Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning sequence reads or long query sequences against a large reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date. Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a component of BWA, which is available at http://github.com/lh3/bwa. Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org",

They differ substantially from their adult counterparts in both their underlying genetic alterations and in the infrequency with which they transform to higher grade tumors. Nonetheless, children with low grade glioma are a therapeutic challenge due to the heterogeneity in their clinical behavior ‚Äì in particular, those with incomplete surgical resection often suffer repeat progressions with resultant morbidity and, in some cases, mortality. The identification of up-regulation of the RAS‚Äìmitogen-activated protein kinase (RAS/MAPK) pathway as a near universal feature of these tumors has led to the development of targeted therapeutics aimed at improving responses while mitigating patient morbidity. Here, we review how molecular information can help to further define the entities which fall under the umbrella of pediatric-type low-grade glioma. In doing so we discuss the specific molecular drivers of pediatric low grade glioma and how to effectively test for them, review the newest therapeutic agents and their utility in treating this disease, and propose a risk-based stratification system that considers both clinical and molecular parameters to aid clinicians in making treatment decisions.</jats:p>",

Although they are not represented in 2016 updated WHO classification of CNS tumors, their diagnostic recognition is important because of clinical consequences. We have introduced a diagnostic method based on transcription profiling of tumor specific signature genes from formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tumor blocks using NanoString nCounter Technology. Altogether, 14 out of 187 (7.4%) high grade pediatric brain tumors were diagnosed with either of four new CNS categories. Histopathological examination of the tumors confirmed, that they demonstrate a spectrum of morphology mimicking other CNS high grade tumors. However, they also exhibit some suggestive histopathological and immunohistochemical features that allow for a presumptive diagnosis prior to molecular assessment. Clinical characteristics of patients corroborated with the previous findings for CNS EFT-CIC, CNS NB-FOXR2 and CNS HGNET-MN1 patients, with a favorable survival rate for the latter two groups. Among six CNS HGNET-BCOR patients, three patients are long term survivors, suggesting possible heterogeneity within this molecular category of tumors. In summary, we confirmed the effectiveness of NanoString method using a single, multi-gene tumor specific signature and recommend this novel approach for identification of either one of the four newly described CNS tumor entities.</jats:p>",

We examined 41 patients with DNT, MNGT, or PLNTY for histologic features, genomic findings, and progression-free survival (PFS). Genomic analysis included sequence and copy number variants and RNA-sequencing. Classic DNT (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ26) was compared with those with diffuse growth without cortical nodules (n‚Äâ=‚Äâ15), 6 of which exhibited impressive CD34 staining classifying them as PLNTY. Genomic analysis was complete in 33, with sequence alterations recurrently identified in BRAF, FGFR1, NF1, and PDGFRA, as well as 7 fusion genes involving FGFR2, FGFR1, NTRK2, and BRAF. Genetic alterations did not distinguish between MNGTs, DNTs, or PLNTYs; however, FGFR1 alterations were confined to DNT, and PLNTYs contained BRAF V600E or FGFR2 fusion genes. Analysis of PFS showed no significant difference by histology or genetic alteration; however, numbers were small and follow-up time short. Further molecular characterization of a PLNTY-related gene fusion, FGFR2-CTNNA3, demonstrated oncogenic potential via MAPK/PI3K/mTOR pathway activation. Overall, DNT-MNGT spectrum tumors exhibit diverse genomic alterations, with more than half (19/33) leading to MAPK/PI3K pathway alterations.</jats:p>",

These activating<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>alterations in LGNET can include tandem duplication of the exons encoding the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain, in-frame gene fusions most often with<jats:italic>TACC1</jats:italic>as the partner, or hotspot missense mutations within the tyrosine kinase domain (either at p.N546 or p.K656). However, the specificity of these different<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>events for the various LGNET subtypes and accompanying genetic alterations are not well defined. Here we performed comprehensive genomic and epigenomic characterization on a diverse cohort of 30 LGNET with<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>alterations. We identified that RGNT harbors a distinct epigenetic signature compared to other LGNET with<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>alterations, and is uniquely characterized by<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>kinase domain hotspot missense mutations in combination with either<jats:italic>PIK3CA</jats:italic>or<jats:italic>PIK3R1</jats:italic>mutation, often with accompanying<jats:italic>NF1</jats:italic>or<jats:italic>PTPN11</jats:italic>mutation. In contrast, EVN harbors its own distinct epigenetic signature and is characterized by<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>-<jats:italic>TACC1</jats:italic>fusion as the solitary pathogenic alteration. Additionally, DNT and pilocytic astrocytoma are characterized by either kinase domain tandem duplication or hotspot missense mutations, occasionally with accompanying<jats:italic>NF1</jats:italic>or<jats:italic>PTPN11</jats:italic>mutation, but lacking the accompanying<jats:italic>PIK3CA</jats:italic>or<jats:italic>PIK3R1</jats:italic>mutation that characterizes RGNT. The glial component of LGNET with<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>alterations typically has a predominantly oligodendroglial morphology, and many of the pilocytic astrocytomas with<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>alterations lack the biphasic pattern, piloid processes, and Rosenthal fibers that characterize pilocytic astrocytomas with<jats:italic>BRAF</jats:italic>mutation or fusion. Together, this analysis improves the classification and histopathologic stratification of LGNET with<jats:italic>FGFR1</jats:italic>alterations.</jats:p>",

The enzymatic activity of telomerase is related but not equivalent to the expression of TERT, the catalytic subunit of the complex. Here we show that telomerase enzymatic activity can be robustly estimated from the expression of a 13-gene signature. We demonstrate the validity of the expression-based approach, named EXTEND, using cell lines, cancer samples, and non-neoplastic samples. When applied to over 9,000 tumors and single cells, we find a strong correlation between telomerase activity and cancer stemness. This correlation is largely driven by a small population of proliferating cancer cells that exhibits both high telomerase activity and cancer stemness. This study establishes a computational framework for quantifying telomerase enzymatic activity and provides new insights into the relationships among telomerase, cancer proliferation, and stemness.</jats:p>",

Their proximity to eloquent brainstem structures means that the pathology itself and the treatment thereof can be associated with significant morbidity. The vast majority of these tumors are sporadic, with the remainder arising as a result of the genetic syndrome Neurofibromatosis Type 2 or, more rarely, LZTR1-related schwannomatosis. The natural history of these tumors is extremely variable, with some tumors not displaying any evidence of growth, others demonstrating early, persistent growth and a small number growing following an extended period of indolence. Emerging evidence now suggests that far from representing Schwann cell proliferation only, the tumor microenvironment is complex, with inflammation proposed to play a key role in their growth. In this review, we provide an overview of this new evidence, including the role played by immune cell infiltration, the underlying molecular pathways involved, and biomarkers for detecting this inflammation in vivo. Given the limitations of current treatments, there is a pressing need for novel therapies to aid in the management of this condition, and we conclude by proposing areas for future research that could lead to the development of therapies targeted toward inflammation in vestibular schwannoma.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Pediatric Adamantinomatous Craniopharyngiomas (ACPs) are histologically benign brain tumors that often follow an aggressive clinical course. Their suprasellar location leaves them in close proximity to critical neurological and vascular structures and often results in significant neuroendocrine morbidity. Current treatment paradigms, involving surgical resection and radiotherapy, confer significant morbidity to patients and there is an obvious need to discover effective and safe alternative treatments. Recent years have witnessed significant efforts to fully detail the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic make-up of these tumors, in an attempt to identify potential therapeutic targets. These studies have resulted in ever mounting evidence that inflammatory processes and the immune response play a critical role in the pathogenesis of both the solid and cystic portion of ACPs. Several inflammatory and immune markers have been identified in both the cyst fluid and solid tumor tissue of ACP. Due to the existence of effective agents that target them, IL-6 and immune checkpoint inhibitors seem to present the most likely immediate candidates for clinical trials of targeted immune-related therapy in ACP. If effective, such agents may result in a paradigm shift in treatment that ultimately reduces morbidity and results in better outcomes for our patients.",

In addition, events such as polymerase read-throughs, mis-mapping due to gene homology, and fusions occurring in healthy normal tissue require informed filtering, making it difficult for researchers and clinicians to rapidly discern gene fusions that might be true underlying oncogenic drivers of a tumor and in some cases, appropriate targets for therapy.</jats:p>\n              </jats:sec><jats:sec>\n                <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n                <jats:p>We developed <jats:italic>annoFuse</jats:italic>, an R package, and <jats:italic>shinyFuse</jats:italic>, a companion web application, to annotate, prioritize, and explore biologically-relevant expressed gene fusions, downstream of fusion calling.

Here we present Lancet, an accurate and sensitive somatic variant caller, which detects SNVs and indels by jointly analyzing reads from tumor and matched normal samples using colored de Bruijn graphs. We demonstrate, through extensive experimental comparison on synthetic and real whole-genome sequencing datasets, that Lancet has better accuracy, especially for indel detection, than widely used somatic callers, such as MuTect, MuTect2, LoFreq, Strelka, and Strelka2. Lancet features a reliable variant scoring system, which is essential for variant prioritization, and detects low-frequency mutations without sacrificing the sensitivity to call longer insertions and deletions empowered by the local-assembly engine. In addition to genome-wide analysis, Lancet allows inspection of somatic variants in graph space, which augments the traditional read alignment visualization to help confirm a variant of interest.

Somatic calling was generally consistent between the two platforms despite minor differences at the read level. We designed and implemented a novel pipeline for the analysis of tumor-normal samples, using multiple variant callers. We show that coupled with a high-confidence filtering strategy, the use of combination of tools improves the accuracy of somatic variant calling. We also demonstrate the utility of the dataset by creating an artificial purity ladder to evaluate the somatic pipeline and benchmark methods for estimating purity and ploidy from tumor-normal pairs. The data and results of the pipeline are made accessible to the cancer genomics community.</jats:p>",

The strengths of this approach over single gene analysis include noise and dimension reduction, as well as greater biological interpretability. As molecular profiling experiments move beyond simple case-control studies, robust and flexible GSE methodologies are needed that can model pathway activity within highly heterogeneous data sets.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Results</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>To address this challenge, we introduce Gene Set Variation Analysis (GSVA), a GSE method that estimates variation of pathway activity over a sample population in an unsupervised manner. We demonstrate the robustness of GSVA in a comparison with current state of the art sample-wise enrichment methods. Further, we provide examples of its utility in differential pathway activity and survival analysis. Lastly, we show how GSVA works analogously with data from both microarray and RNA-seq experiments.</jats:p>\n          </jats:sec>\n          <jats:sec>\n            <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n            <jats:p>GSVA provides increased power to detect subtle pathway activity changes over a sample population in comparison to corresponding methods. While GSE methods are generally regarded as end points of a bioinformatic analysis, GSVA constitutes a starting point to build pathway-centric models of biology. Moreover, GSVA contributes to the current need of GSE methods for RNA-seq data.

UMAP is constructed from a theoretical framework based in Riemannian geometry and algebraic topology. The result is a practical scalable algorithm that applies to real world data. The UMAP algorithm is competitive with t-SNE for visualization quality, and arguably preserves more of the global structure with superior run time performance. Furthermore, UMAP has no computational restrictions on embedding dimension, making it viable as a general purpose dimension reduction technique for machine learning.",

The primate-specific microRNA cluster on chromosome 19 (C19MC) is exclusively expressed in the placenta, embryonic stem cells and certain cancers however, its role in EMT gene regulation is unknown. <jats:italic>In situ</jats:italic> hybridization for miR-517a/c, a C19MC cistron microRNA, in first trimester human placentas displayed strong expression in villous trophoblasts and a gradual decrease from proximal to distal cell columns as cytotrophoblasts differentiate into invasive EVTs. To investigate the role of C19MC in the regulation of EMT genes, we employed the CRISPR/dCas9 Synergistic Activation Mediator (SAM) system, which induced robust transcriptional activation of the entire C19MC cistron and resulted in suppression of EMT associated genes. Exposure of human iPSCs to hypoxia or differentiation of iPSCs into either cytotrophoblast-stem-like cells or EVT-like cells under hypoxia reduced C19MC expression and increased EMT genes. Furthermore, transcriptional activation of the C19MC cistron induced the expression of OCT4 and FGF4 and accelerated cellular reprogramming. This study establishes the CRISPR/dCas9 SAM as a powerful tool that enables activation of the entire C19MC cistron and uncovers its novel role in suppressing EMT genes critical for maintaining the epithelial cytotrophoblasts stem cell phenotype.</jats:p>",

To determine the factors that promote the development and evolution of these tumors, we analyzed the genomes of 134 high-grade meningiomas and compared this information with data from 595 previously published meningiomas. High-grade meningiomas had a higher mutation burden than low-grade meningiomas but did not harbor any significantly mutated genes aside from <jats:italic>NF2</jats:italic>. High-grade meningiomas also possessed significantly elevated rates of chromosomal gains and losses, especially among tumors with monosomy 22. Meningiomas previously treated with adjuvant radiation had significantly more copy number alterations than radiation-induced or radiation-na√Øve meningiomas. Across serial recurrences, genomic disruption preceded the emergence of nearly all mutations, remained largely uniform across time, and when present in low-grade meningiomas correlated with subsequent progression to a higher grade. In contrast to the largely stable copy number alterations, mutations were strikingly heterogeneous across tumor recurrences, likely due to extensive geographic heterogeneity in the primary tumor. While high-grade meningiomas harbored significantly fewer overtly targetable alterations than low-grade meningiomas, they contained numerous mutations that are predicted to be neoantigens, suggesting that immunologic targeting may be of therapeutic value.</jats:p>",

    "abstract": "Embryonal tumors (ET) of the central nervous system (CNS) in children encompass a wide clinical spectrum of aggressive malignancies. Until recently, the overlapping morphological features of these lesions posed a diagnostic challenge and undermined discovery of optimal treatment strategies. However, with the advances in genomic technology and the outpouring of biological data over the last decade, clear insights into the molecular heterogeneity of these tumors are now well delineated. The major subtypes of ETs of the CNS in children include medulloblastoma, atypical teratoid rhabdoid tumor (ATRT), and embryonal tumors with multilayered rosettes (ETMR), which are now biologically and clinically characterized as different entities. These important developments have paved the way for treatments guided by risk stratification as well as novel targeted therapies in efforts to improve survival and reduce treatment burden.",
