    "abstract": "Pediatric brain tumors are the leading cause of cancer death in children with an urgent need for innovative therapies. Here we show that the cell surface oncoprotein glypican 2 (GPC2) is highly expressed on multiple lethal pediatric brain tumors, including medulloblastomas, embryonal tumors with multi-layered rosettes, other CNS embryonal tumors, as well as definable subsets of highly malignant gliomas. To target GPC2 on these pediatric brain tumors with adoptive cellular therapies and mitigate potential inflammatory neurotoxicity, we developed four mRNA chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell constructs using the highly GPC2-specific fully human D3 single chain variable fragment. First, we validated and prioritized these CARs using in vitro cytotoxicity and T cell degranulation assays with GPC2-expressing neuroblastoma cells. Next, we expanded the testing of the two most potent GPC2-directed CAR constructs prioritized from these studies to GPC2-expressing medulloblastoma and high-grade glioma cell lines, showing significant GPC2-specific cell death in multiple models. Finally, locoregional delivery bi-weekly of two to four million GPC2-directed mRNA CAR T cells induced significant and sustained tumor regression in two orthotopic medulloblastoma models, and significantly prolonged survival in an aggressive orthotopic thalamic diffuse midline glioma model. No GPC2-directed CAR T cell related neurologic or systemic toxicity was observed. Taken together, these data show that GPC2 is a highly differentially expressed cell surface protein on multiple malignant pediatric brain tumors that can be targeted safely with local delivery of mRNA CAR T cells.One Sentence Summary Glypican 2 is expressed on the surface of multiple pediatric brain tumors and can be successfully targeted with mRNA chimeric antigen receptor T cells.Competing Interest StatementT.S. is currently employed by Spark Therapeutics.

    "abstract": "Comprehensive disease gene discovery in both common and rare diseases will require the efficient and accurate detection of all classes of genetic variation across tens to hundreds of thousands of human samples. We describe here a novel assembly-based approach to variant calling, the GATK HaplotypeCaller (HC) and Reference Confidence Model (RCM), that determines genotype likelihoods independently per-sample but performs joint calling across all samples within a project simultaneously. We show by calling over 90,000 samples from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) that, in contrast to other algorithms, the HC-RCM scales efficiently to very large sample sizes without loss in accuracy; and that the accuracy of indel variant calling is superior in comparison to other algorithms. More importantly, the HC-RCM produces a fully squared-off matrix of genotypes across all samples at every genomic position being investigated. The HC-RCM is a novel, scalable, assembly-based algorithm with abundant applications for population genetics and clinical studies.",

Assembly implies whole haplotypes and read pairs, rather than single bases, as the atomic units of biological variation and sequencing evidence, improving variant calling.

    "abstract": "Motivation Fusion genes created by genomic rearrangements can be potent drivers of tumorigenesis. However, accurate identification of functionally fusion genes from genomic sequencing requires whole genome sequencing, since exonic sequencing alone is often insufficient. Transcriptome sequencing provides a direct, highly effective alternative for capturing molecular evidence of expressed fusions in the precision medicine pipeline, but current methods tend to be inefficient or insufficiently accurate, lacking in sensitivity or predicting large numbers of false positives. Here, we describe STAR-Fusion, a method that is both fast and accurate in identifying fusion transcripts from RNA-Seq data.\nResults We benchmarked STAR-Fusion‚Äôs fusion detection accuracy using both simulated and genuine Illumina paired-end RNA-Seq data, and show that it has superior performance compared to popular alternative fusion detection methods.\nAvailability and implementation STAR-Fusion is implemented in Perl, freely available as open source software at http://star-fusion.github.io, and supported on Linux.\nContact bhaas{at}broadinstitute.org",

    "abstract": "Traditionally, statistical training has focused primarily on mathematical derivations and proofs of statistical tests. The process of developing the technical artifact‚Äîthat is, the paper, dashboard, or other deliverable‚Äîis much less frequently taught, presumably because of an aversion to cookbookery or prescribing specific software choices. In this paper I argue that it‚Äôs critical to teach analysts how to go about developing an analysis in order to maximize the probability that their analysis is reproducible, accurate, and collaborative. A critical component of this is adopting a blameless postmortem culture. By encouraging the use of and fluency in tooling that implements these opinions, as well as a blameless way of correcting course as analysts encounter errors, we as a community can foster the growth of processes that fail the practitioners as infrequently as possible.",

Diffuse PLGGs comprise a set of uncommon subtypes that exhibit invasive growth and are therefore especially challenging clinically. We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription factor\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas in the related gene\n            <jats:italic>v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog</jats:italic>\n            (\n            <jats:italic>MYB</jats:italic>\n            ) on 6q23.3.

Truncated\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional tumors with\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            partial duplication.

As an alignment post-pass, its own runtime overhead is negligible, while dramatically reducing overall pipeline complexity and runtime.

Diffuse PLGGs comprise a set of uncommon subtypes that exhibit invasive growth and are therefore especially challenging clinically. We performed high-resolution copy-number analysis on 44 formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded diffuse PLGGs to identify recurrent alterations. Diffuse PLGGs exhibited fewer such alterations than adult low-grade gliomas, but we identified several significantly recurrent events. The most significant event, 8q13.1 gain, was observed in 28% of diffuse astrocytoma grade IIs and resulted in partial duplication of the transcription factor\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            with truncation of its C-terminal negative-regulatory domain. A similar recurrent deletion-truncation breakpoint was identified in two angiocentric gliomas in the related gene\n            <jats:italic>v-myb avian myeloblastosis viral oncogene homolog</jats:italic>\n            (\n            <jats:italic>MYB</jats:italic>\n            ) on 6q23.3. Whole-genome sequencing of a\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            -rearranged diffuse astrocytoma grade II demonstrated\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            tandem duplication and few other events. Truncated\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            transcripts identified in this tumor induced anchorage-independent growth in 3T3 cells and tumor formation in nude mice. Truncated transcripts were also expressed in two additional tumors with\n            <jats:italic>MYBL1</jats:italic>\n            partial duplication. Our results define clinically relevant molecular subclasses of diffuse PLGGs and highlight a potential role for the MYB family in the biology of low-grade gliomas.\n          </jats:p>",

All tumors tested showed loss of H3K27me3 staining, with evidence of overexpression of the EZH inhibitory protein (EZHIP) in the H3 wildtype cases. Although some tumors indeed showed a bithalamic growth pattern, a significant proportion of tumors occurred in the unilateral thalamus or in other (predominantly midline) locations.</jats:p>\n               </jats:sec>\n               <jats:sec>\n                  <jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title>\n                  <jats:p>Our findings present a distinct molecular class of pediatric-type malignant gliomas largely overlapping with the recently reported bithalamic gliomas characterized by EGFR alteration, but additionally showing a broader spectrum of EGFR alterations and tumor localization.

    "abstract": "Summary: BWA-MEM is a new alignment algorithm for aligning sequence reads or long query sequences against a large reference genome such as human. It automatically chooses between local and end-to-end alignments, supports paired-end reads and performs chimeric alignment. The algorithm is robust to sequencing errors and applicable to a wide range of sequence lengths from 70bp to a few megabases. For mapping 100bp sequences, BWA-MEM shows better performance than several state-of-art read aligners to date. Availability and implementation: BWA-MEM is implemented as a component of BWA, which is available at http://github.com/lh3/bwa. Contact: hengli@broadinstitute.org",

PERLS + correlated significantly with median progression-free survival (PFS) of 9.63 months (95%‚ÄâCI 7.82 to not reached (NR)) versus 2.69 months (95%‚ÄâCI 1.81 to 5.52; p=0.03). In an independent validation cohort (N=36), median PFS was NR (95%‚ÄâCI 7.9 to NR) versus 2.00 months (95%‚ÄâCI 1.3 to 4.5; p=0.04) for PERLS + and PERLS‚àí, respectively; overall survival (OS) followed a similar but non-significant trend. In the pooled cohort (N=111), PERLS + correlated significantly with PFS and OS. PERLS did not correlate with outcome in the polychemotherapy cohort. PERLS did not correlate with clinical characteristics but was significantly associated with baseline circulating na√Øve CD4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> T cells and the increase of memory T cells post-ICB treatment. Accumulation of memory T cells during treatment was linked to CD4<jats:sup>+</jats:sup> T cell polyfunctionality. The composite score was evaluated in the pooled cohort (N=68). The median OS for good, intermediate and poor composite scores was NR (95%‚ÄâCI NR to NR), 8.54 months (95%‚ÄâCI 4.96 to NR) and 2.42 months (95%‚ÄâCI 1.97 to 15.5; p=0.001), respectively. The median PFS was 12.60 months (95%‚ÄâCI 9.63 to NR), 2.58 months (95%‚ÄâCI 1.74 to 7.29) and 1.76 months (95%‚ÄâCI 1.31 to 4.57; p&lt;0.0001), respectively.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title>Conclusions</jats:title><jats:p>Elevated PERLS, determined from a blood sample before immunotherapy, was correlated with benefit from PD-(L)1 blockers in aNSCLC.</jats:p></jats:sec>",
