## Figure Titles and Legends
**Figure 1. Overview of the OpenPBTA Project.**
A, The Children's Brain Tumor Network and the Pacific Pediatric Neuro-oncology Consortium collected tumor samples from 943 patients. To date, 38 cell lines were created from tumor tissue and over 2000 specimens were sequenced (N = 1035 RNA-Seq, N = 940 WGS, and N = 32 WXS or Targeted panel). Data was harmonized by the Kids First Data Resource Center using an Amazon S3 framwork within CAVATICA. B, Processed data was released through the OpenPBTA GitHub project, through which contributors filed issues andd developed code for additional analyses within docker. Additional analysis details can be found in **Figure {@fig:FigS1}**. Simultaneously, this manuscript was written in GitHub using Manubot. All analysis and manuscript code was reviewed and continuously integrated using CircleCI. C, Stacked bar plot summary of the number of biospecimens per phase of therapy  per broad histology.
