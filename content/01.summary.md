## Summary
<!-- The summary is a single paragraph no longer than 150 words. An effective summary includes the following elements: (1) a brief background of the question that avoids statements about how a process is not well understood; (2) a description of the results and approaches/model systems framed in the context of their conceptual interest; and (3) an indication of the broader significance of the work. We discourage novelty claims (e.g., use of the word “novel”) because they are overused, tend not to add meaning, and are difficult to verify. Please do not include references in the summary.

Pediatric brain and spinal cancer are the leading disease-related cause of death in children, thus we urgently need curative therapeutic strategies for these tumors.
To accelerate such discoveries, the Children's Brain Tumor Network and Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium created a systematic process for tumor biobanking, model generation, and sequencing with immediate access to harmonized data.
We leverage these data to create OpenPBTA, an open collaborative project which establishes over 40 scalable analysis modules to genomically characterize 1,043 pediatric brain tumors.
We utilize transcriptomic classification to report _TP53_ loss as a significant marker for poor overall survival in ependymomas and H3 K28-altered diffuse midline gliomas and further identify universal _TP53_ dysregulation in mismatch repair-deficient hypermutant high-grade gliomas. 
OpenPBTA has emerged as a foundational analysis platform actively being applied to study other pediatric cancers and inform molecular tumor board decision-making, making it an invaluable resource to the pediatric oncology community.
