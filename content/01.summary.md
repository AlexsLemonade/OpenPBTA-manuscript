## Summary
<!-- The summary is a single paragraph no longer than 150 words. An effective summary includes the following elements: (1) a brief background of the question that avoids statements about how a process is not well understood; (2) a description of the results and approaches/model systems framed in the context of their conceptual interest; and (3) an indication of the broader significance of the work. We discourage novelty claims (e.g., use of the word “novel”) because they are overused, tend not to add meaning, and are difficult to verify. Please do not include references in the summary.

As pediatric brain and spinal cord tumors are the leading disease-related cause of death in children, we urgently need novel, curative therapeutic strategies for these tumors.
To accelerate such discoveries, the Children's Brain Tumor Network and Pacific Pediatric Neuro-Oncology Consortium created a systematic process for tumor biobanking, model generation, and sequencing while providing immediate access to harmonized data.
Here, we leverage these data to create OpenPBTA, an open and collaborative project to genomically characterize and molecularly subtype pediatric brain tumor specimens in what is, to our knowledge, the largest cohort of clinically-annotated samples to date.
OpenPBTA establishes over 40 scalable analysis modules to analyze these data and recapitulate key oncogenic drivers across histologies.
OpenPBTA has already emerged as a foundational analysis platform actively being applied to study other pediatric cancers and inform molecular tumor board decision-making, making it an invaluable resource to the pediatric oncology community.
