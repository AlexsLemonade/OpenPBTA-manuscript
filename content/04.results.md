### The Open Pediatric Brain Tumor Atlas

This section will introduce the dataset (e.g., the histologies represented and what data types are included; Figure {@fig:openpbta-overview}A-B) and the process for contributing analytical code and to the manuscript (Figure {@fig:openpbta-overview}C-D).

### Mutational Landscape

This section summarize the mutational landscape of the pediatric brain tumor samples of this dataset. Figure {@fig:openpbta-overview}A shows the tumor mutation burden as compared to adult TCGA brain-related tumors. Figure {@fig:mutational-landscape-overview}B-C show concordance of these samples with mutational signatures from COSMIC [@url:https://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic] and Alexandrov et al, 2013 [@doi:10.1038/nature12477] signature sets.
