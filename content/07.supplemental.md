## Supplemental Information Titles and Legends
<!-- TODO: Add legends, update S4 if we keep immune deconv figures. -->

![**Figure S1. OpenPBTA Project Workflow, Related to Figure 1.** Biospecimens and data were collected by CBTN and PNOC and genomic sequencing and harmonization (orange boxes) were performed by the Kids First Data Resource Center (KFDRC). Analyses in the green boxes were performed by contributors of the OpenPBTA project. Output files are denoted in blue. Figure created with biorender.com.](images/supplement/Figure-S1.png){#fig:FigS1}

![**Figure S2. Validation of Consensus SNV calls and Tumor Mutation Burden, Related to Figures 2 and 3.**  Correlation (A) and violin (B) plots of mutation variant allele frequencies (VAFs) comparing the variant callers (Lancet, Strelka2, Mutect2, and VarDict) used for PBTA samples. Upset plot (C) showing overlap of variant calls. Correlation (D) and violin (E) plots of mutation variant allele frequencies (VAFs) comparing the variant callers (Lancet, Strelka2, and Mutect2) used for TCGA samples. Upset plot (F) showing overlap of variant calls. Cumulative distribution TMB plots (G) for PBTA and TCGA tumors using consensus SNV calls.](images/supplement/Figure-S2.png){#fig:FigS2}

Related to Figure 4**.** First two dimensions from UMAP of sample transcriptome data with points colored by `molecular_subtype` for A, medulloblastoma, B, ependymoma, C, low-grade glioma, and D, high-grade diffuse astrocytic tumors. E, Receiver Operating Characteristic for _TP53_ classifier run on FPKM of poly-A RNA-Seq samples. F, Violin and box plots of _TP53_ scores plotted by _TP53_ alteration type in poly-A RNA-Seq samples. Correlation plots for telomerase scores (EXTEND) versus RNA expression of _TERT_ (G) and _TERC_ (H).](images/supplement/Figure-S5.png){#fig:FigS5}
